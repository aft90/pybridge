About PyBridge
==============

PyBridge allows you to play the card game of (contract) bridge, with human
players, over the Internet or a local network.

There are many Web resources for learning to play bridge. A good starting point
is the Wikipedia: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge.


Release Notes
=============

To use PyBridge, you need to connect to a game server. You have two options:

  - Connect to a public server. A list of known public servers can be found on
    the project website.

  - Run a PyBridge game server yourself, using the pybridge-server script.

When connecting to a PyBridge server for the first time, you need to ensure
that the "Register as New User" checkbox is ticked.

Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file. Details of new
features, bug fixes and other changes can be found in the NEWS file.

Your feedback, bug reports and ideas for new features are especially welcome.
