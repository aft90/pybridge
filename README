PyBridge allows you to play the card game of (contract) bridge, with human
players, over the Internet or a local network.

For information on learning to play bridge, consult the Wikipedia article:

Release Notes
=============

To use PyBridge, you will need to create your own server, or connect to a
public server: a list of known public servers can be found on the project
website. When connecting to a server for the first time, ensure that the
"Register as New User" checkbox is ticked.

Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file. Details of
functionality are in the ChangeLog.

Please remember this is an initial release, which should be considered
alpha software: some functionality may not work as intended, or work at all.
Your feedback, bug reports and feature requests are especially welcome. ;-)
