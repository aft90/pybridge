Installing PyBridge
===================

If you want to install PyBridge, change to the directory where you unpacked the
source tarball, then type (as root):

python setup.py install

We recommend that, if your distribution provides PyBridge packages, you should
install from packages. Packages are available for Debian GNU/Linux and its
derivatives (including Ubuntu) thanks to David Watson <dwatson@debian.org>.

Alternatively, you can run PyBridge from the extracted tarball archive. Change
to the PyBridge "bin/" directory, then type "./pybridge" to run the graphical
client, or "./pybridge-server" to run the standalone server.


Requirements
============

You will need the following software installed to run PyBridge:

  - Python (>= 2.4) - http://www.python.org/
  - Twisted Core (>= 2.0) - http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedCore
  - Zope Interface (>= 3.0) - http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface


To run the PyBridge client, the following software is also required:

  - GTK+ (>= 2.8) - http://www.gtk.org/
  - PyGTK (>= 2.8) - http://www.pygtk.org/
  - Cairo (>= 1.0) - http://cairographics.org/
  - PyCairo (>= 1.0) - http://cairographics.org/pycairo/
  - ConfigObj (>= 4.0) -http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html 


To run the standalone PyBridge server, the following software is also required:

  - SQLObject (>= 0.7) - http://www.sqlobject.org/
  - A database server compatible with SQLObject: see "Configuring the Server".


Configuring the Server
======================

By default, the standalone server creates and uses a SQLite database in the
~/.pybridge/ directory. This is suitable for hosting LAN games, but if you wish
to operate a high-load PyBridge server on the Internet, it may be necessary
to switch to an external RDBMS, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

To change the database settings, edit the ~/.pybridge/server.cfg file. The
fields to change are documented in the pybridge/server/config.py module.
