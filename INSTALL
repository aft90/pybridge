Installing PyBridge
===================

If you want to install PyBridge, change to the directory where you unpacked the
tarball, then type (as root):

python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can run PyBridge from the extracted tarball. Change to the
PyBridge "bin/" directory, then type "./pybridge" to run the client, or
"./pybridge-server" to run the server.


Requirements
============

You'll need the following software installed to run PyBridge:

- Python (>= 2.3) - http://www.python.org/
- Twisted Core (>= 1.3) - http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedCore
- GTK+ (>= 2.6) - http://www.gtk.org/
- PyGTK (>= 2.6) - http://www.pygtk.org/

(The GTK+ and PyGTK libraries are not necessary to run the standalone server.)
