Installing PyBridge
===================

If you want to install PyBridge, change to the directory where you unpacked the
source tarball, then type (as root):

python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can run PyBridge from the extracted tarball archive. Change
to the PyBridge 'bin/' directory, then type './pybridge' to run the graphical
client, or './pybridge-server' to run the standalone server.

PyBridge packages are available for Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu systems, thanks
to David Watson <dwatson@debian.org>. Please visit:

  - For Debian: http://packages.debian.org/pybridge/
  - For Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/pybridge/

Users of Microsoft Windows may wish to use the 'py2exe' PyBridge distribution,
which provides native executable (.exe) versions of the 'pybridge' and
'pybridge-server' scripts, and bundles all the library software (see below)
required to run PyBridge.


Requirements
============

You will need the following software installed to run PyBridge:

  - Python (>= 2.4) - http://www.python.org/
  - Twisted Core (>= 2.0) - http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedCore
  - Zope Interface (>= 3.0) - http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface


To run the PyBridge client, the following software is also required:

  - GTK+ (>= 2.8) - http://www.gtk.org/
  - PyGTK (>= 2.8) - http://www.pygtk.org/
  - Cairo (>= 1.0) - http://cairographics.org/
  - PyCairo (>= 1.0) - http://cairographics.org/pycairo/
  - ConfigObj (>= 4.0) -http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html 


To run the standalone PyBridge server, the following software is also required:

  - SQLObject (>= 0.7) - http://www.sqlobject.org/
  - A database server compatible with SQLObject: see "Configuring the Server".


Configuring the Server
======================

By default, the standalone server creates and uses a SQLite database in the
~/.pybridge/ directory. This is suitable for hosting LAN games, but if you wish
to operate a high-load PyBridge server on the Internet, it may be necessary
to switch to an external database server, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

To change the database settings, edit the ~/.pybridge/server.cfg file. The
fields to change are documented in the pybridge/server/config.py module.
