Installing PyBridge
===================

If you want to install PyBridge, change to the directory where you unpacked the
tarball, then type:

python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can run PyBridge from the extracted tarball. Change to the
PyBridge "bin/" directory, then type "./pybridge" to run the client, or
"./pybridge-server" to run the server.
