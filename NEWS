0.2.0 (XX August 2006)
======================

Features:

- Substantial rewrite of network code. Focus on splitting discrete services
  into separate components and making full use of Twisted's pb.Cacheable.
  (Support for other games can be added, simply by writing new table modules
  for server and client subclassing LocalTable and RemoteTable respectively.)

- Introduction of an event handler and callback mechanism, which provides an
  indirect interface between network code and user interface components.

- Facelift for user interface: tables now display as separate windows,
  enhancements to CardArea display widget, new icons.

- Basic table chat support.

- Initial support for internationalization and localization via gettext.
