=====================
0.3.0 (25 June 2007)
=====================

New features
------------

  - Architecture:

    - Separation of bridge game logic from 'table' code in [Local|Remote]Table
      and Game classes. This enables other games to be implemented as separate
      packages and to be supported by the existing network code.


  - Bridge facilities:

    - Implementation of Thomas Andrews' "impossible bridge book" algorithm,
      which provides a one-to-one correspondence between all possible hand deals
      and numerical index values.
      See http://bridge.thomasoandrews.com/impossible/ for details.


  - Miscellaneous:
 
    - Use ConfigObj to provide settings management for the graphical client.
      This introduces a dependency on ConfigObj.

    - Manual pages included in source distribution.


  - Server:
  
    - Use SQLObject (an object relational mapper, see http://www.sqlobject.org/)
      to provide user account database; replaces the flat-file username/password
      structure used previously. This introduces a dependency on SQLObject and
      a compatible database backend - see the INSTALL file for more information.


  - User interface:
  
    - Card area display reimplemented in Cairo, with enhancements:

      - Rotation of table view when user selects a position to play.

      - Separation of display canvas from card and hand logic, for reusability.
        The canvas module may be useful for other projects.

    - Introduction of a preferences dialog, allowing user to customise the
      appearance of the bridge game display.

    - Error notification to user when connection is dropped unexpectedly;
      require confirmation when user requests disconnection whilst playing game.


======================
0.2.1 (16 August 2006)
======================

Bug fixes
---------

  - Fixed setup.py script to install source package and supporting files in the
    standard /usr/ directories.

  - Updated pybridge.environment and bin/* scripts to work with both the source
    and installation directory layouts.


======================
0.2.0 (14 August 2006)
======================

New features
------------

  - Substantial rewrite of network code. Focus on splitting discrete services
    into separate components and making full use of Twisted's pb.Cacheable.
    (Support for other games can be added simply by writing new table modules
    for server and client subclassing LocalTable and RemoteTable respectively.)

  - Introduction of an event handler and callback mechanism, which provides an
    indirect interface between network code and user interface components.

  - Facelift for user interface: tables now display as separate windows,
    enhancements to CardArea display widget, new icons and logo artwork.

  - Basic table chat support.

  - Initial support for internationalization and localization via gettext.
